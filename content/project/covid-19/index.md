title: "Forecasting Covid-19 Dynamics"
summary: "This research project focuses on building diverse methods using data-driven machine learning techniques to improve forecasting of COVID-19 dynamics. In particular we are evaluating utility of topological predictors from satellite observations to model the current and future COVID-19 spatio-temporal progression and clinical severity of the disease."
